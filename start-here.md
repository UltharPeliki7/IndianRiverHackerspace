# Start Here (Onboarding)

## 1) The deal in one minute
- This is a **safety-first, documentation-first** shop.
- You can be a complete beginner.
- You do not get unattended access until you’re verified and certified for the tools you want.

## 2) Access modes
**A) Hosted / supervised use (default for beginners)**
- You book a slot.
- You work with a host/instructor.
- Best path for first projects and learning fundamentals.

**B) Staffed open sessions (biweekly/monthly)**
- Structured, staffed time.
- Intended for tours, demos, onboarding, and supervised making.
- Not a free-roam machine-tool free-for-all.

**C) Unattended use (verified users only)**
- Allowed only after verification + per-machine certification.
- Some machines may still require a buddy/host depending on risk.

## 3) Verification (required before unattended access)
You must complete all of the following:
- **Interview** (intent, experience, risk awareness, fit)
- **Knowledge verification** (basic shop safety + tool-specific fundamentals)
- **Mandatory training video** (shop-specific rules and emergency procedures)
- Agreement to all policies (safety, conduct, incident reporting, privacy, IP)

## 4) Certifications (per machine)
You get certified **per tool class**. Typical path:
- **Level 0 — Orientation**
  - PPE rules, housekeeping, emergency stop mindset, “stop work authority”
- **Level 1 — General tools**
  - Hand tools, measuring basics, safe clamping, drill press basics (if applicable)
- **Level 2 — Machine tools (restricted + occupancy limits)**
  - Lathe / mill / surface grinder
  - Demonstrate: setup, safe operation, shutdown, cleanup, what-not-to-do
- **Level 3 — Advanced / special**
  - Any process that materially increases risk or complexity (defined as needed)

## 5) Occupancy + supervision limits (high-risk area)
- Certain machines and operations have **maximum occupancy**.
- Some operations may require:
  - “No solo use”
  - Host present
  - Buddy rule
- If you violate this, access can be suspended.

## 6) Hard prohibitions (non-negotiable)
- No firearms or weapons manufacturing.
- “Weapons” includes knives/swords and weapon parts/accessories.
- No ammunition or reloading work.
- No indoor drone flying.
- No drop-in genetic work; genetics is controlled program only.
- No chemistry framed/operated as synthesis-for-production.

## 7) Bio/Chem scope (what’s actually allowed)
**Chemistry (Scope A)**
- Demonstrations + small-scale prep of standard low-hazard reagents for in-house demos:
  - buffers, saline, indicators, basic stains
- No scale-up; no high-hazard syntheses; no “precursor manufacturing” framing.

**Microbiology (Scope A)**
- Environmental sampling + microscopy + imaging/video for local ecology education.
- Culturing is limited/controlled by default; no casual long-term culturing of unknowns unless explicitly approved as a program activity.

**Genetics program (gated, long-term)**
- Controlled mycology research for cultivation robustness of fungi.
- Requires registered projects, trained participants, containment/disposal procedures, and **no intentional environmental release**.

## 8) How to join / start using the shop
1. Open a GitHub Issue: **“Request Onboarding”**
   - Include: goals, experience level, tools you want to use, availability.
2. Attend an open session or book an appointment.
3. Complete verification steps.
4. Do your first hosted project.
5. Earn certifications for tools you want.
6. Graduate to unattended use (if approved).

## 9) How projects work (research + builds)
- Every serious project gets:
  - A short description
  - A clear goal (or research question)
  - A “Definition of Done”
  - Safety notes + required tools
- Track it in GitHub Issues; document results in the wiki.

## 10) What gets you removed
- Unsafe behavior, ignoring PPE rules, bypassing certification, unauthorized guests, violating prohibitions, or leaving hazards for others.
- This is enforced quickly to keep the shop viable.

## 11) Quick links you should add next
- Safety Policy
- Training & Certifications
- Tool Inventory
- Incident / Near-miss Reporting
- Code of Conduct
- Access & Scheduling
