# Safety Policy

## 0) Authority and scope
- Safety rules apply to everyone: members, visitors, instructors, and staff.
- Any member may call **STOP WORK** for a safety concern. Work resumes only when the hazard is addressed.
- The space may suspend access immediately for unsafe conduct.

## 1) Access model (safety gating)
- Access is **appointment-based**.
- Staffed open sessions occur **biweekly/monthly** (structured + supervised).
- **Unattended use** is restricted to Verified Users with per-machine certification.

## 2) Verification and certifications
To qualify for unattended access:
- Interview (fit + intent + risk awareness)
- Knowledge verification (general + tool-specific)
- Mandatory training video (shop rules + emergency response)
- Per-machine certification before using any of the following without direct supervision:
  - Lathe, mill, surface grinder, bench grinder
  - CO₂ laser cutter, CNC router (and any other tool designated “restricted”)

## 3) Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Minimum rules:
- **Safety glasses required at all times** in shop work areas.
- Closed-toe shoes required everywhere in the shop.
- Hearing protection required when indicated by signage or tool SOP.
- Respiratory protection required for dusty/fume operations (per SOP).
- Hair tied back; no loose clothing/jewelry near rotating equipment.
- Gloves are **not** permitted near rotating spindles (lathe/mill/drill) except for material handling with power off.

## 4) Machine rules (high-risk equipment)
- Use restricted equipment only if:
  - you are certified for that tool, and
  - the tool is in safe working condition, and
  - you follow the posted SOP.
- No bypassing guards, interlocks, or safety devices.
- Occupancy limits apply in high-risk areas (posted). If the limit is reached, wait.
- Some operations require a buddy/host (“no solo use”) as posted.

## 5) Housekeeping / tool condition
- Leave every station **cleaner than you found it**.
- Return tools, fixturing, and accessories to their labeled locations.
- Report damaged or malfunctioning equipment immediately; tag it OUT OF SERVICE.

## 6) Substances and impairment
- No alcohol or illegal substances on site.
- No use of the space if under the influence of alcohol/drugs or impaired by fatigue.
- Violations can result in immediate removal and suspension.

## 7) Fire, ventilation, and hazardous materials
- Follow posted ventilation rules for lasers, machining mist, sanding, soldering, and finishing.
- Aerosol sprays and high-fume operations are only allowed under designated procedures/locations (if allowed at all).
- Flammables and chemicals must remain in designated storage; no unlabeled containers.

## 8) Bio/Chem scope (safety-bounded)
Chemistry (Scope A):
- Demonstrations + small-scale preparation of standard low-hazard reagents for in-house demos
  (buffers, saline, indicators, basic stains).
- No synthesis-for-production, no scale-up, no “precursor manufacturing.”

Microbiology (Scope A):
- Environmental sampling + microscopy + imaging/video for local ecology education.
- Culturing of unknowns is limited and controlled; no casual long-term culturing.

Genetics program (gated, long-term):
- Controlled mycology research for cultivation robustness is permitted only under a formal program:
  - registered project with objective/methods,
  - trained named participants only,
  - documented containment + disposal,
  - material tracking,
  - **no intentional environmental release**.

## 9) Minors and guests
- Minors may attend only in designated, supervised programs and must follow additional rules.
- Guests are either:
  - not permitted, OR
  - permitted only during staffed classes/events with direct supervision (policy choice).
- No one may “tailgate” into the space; do not open doors for non-authorized persons.

## 10) Photography and recording
- Ask permission before photographing or recording others or their work.
- No recording in restricted areas/programs if posted (e.g., genetics program).
- Additional restrictions apply for minors.

## 11) Emergencies and incident reporting
- Know the location of:
  - first aid kit, eye wash, fire extinguisher, main power disconnect (as applicable)
- Report all injuries and near-misses the same day using the Incident/Near-Miss form.
- If emergency services are required, call 911 first, then notify the host/management.

## 12) Enforcement
- Any of the following may result in immediate suspension:
  - bypassing training/certification
  - unsafe machine use / removing guards
  - failure to wear required PPE
  - bringing prohibited work (weapons/ammo) into the space
  - impairment, reckless behavior, or refusal to follow stop-work
