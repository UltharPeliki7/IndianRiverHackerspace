# Makerspace / Hackerspace

## What this place is
A garage-scale research makerspace where you can learn to build real things and run real projects—without the chaos that ruins most shared shops.

## The tools
**Machine tools (certification required; occupancy limits)**
- Lathe
- Mill
- Surface grinder
- Bench grinder

**Digital fabrication** (certification required)
- CO₂ laser cutter
- CNC router
- 3D printing

**Wood + general fabrication** (certification required)
- Woodworking tooling
- Workholding, hand tools, finishing basics

**Science corner**
- Microscopy + imaging setup for environmental sample videos and local ecology education
- Chemistry demo bench for safe, bounded experiments (see scope)

## How you use it
- **Appointment-based access** for predictable, safe use.
- **Staffed open sessions** biweekly/monthly.
- **Unattended use** only after: interview + knowledge verification + mandatory training video + **per-machine certification**.
- **Research projects** get a project designation with a research question and are tracked in GitHub (issues + wiki).

## Mission
We support citizen science, science literacy, and manufacturing literacy by providing hands-on access to tools, instruction, and shared expertise. We’re building a hub of capability that produces documented learning, prototypes, and research-style projects.

## Scope (what we focus on)
**Core**
- Physics exploration
- Math tutoring
- Robotics
- Drones
- Mapmaking/GIS
- Bookmaking + printmaking
- Woodworking
- Metalworking
- Small-scale fabrication (CNC/laser/3D printing)
- Microbiology (Scope A): environmental sampling + microscopy + videos for local ecology education
- Chemistry (Scope A): interest-based demonstrations + small-scale prep of standard low-hazard lab reagents for in-house demos (buffers, saline, indicators, basic stains)

**Long-term program**
- Controlled mycology research aimed at improving cultivation robustness of fungi for educational and agricultural applications.
- Any strain-improvement or molecular techniques occur only inside a formal, safety-governed program with registered projects, trained participants, documented containment/disposal, and **no intentional environmental release**.



## Hard boundaries (so this stays real and safe)
- No firearms or weapons manufacturing. “Weapons” includes knives/swords and weapon parts/accessories.
- No ammunition or reloading work.
- No indoor drone flying.
- No drop-in genetic work. Genetics is a gated program only.
- No chemistry framed or operated as synthesis-for-production.
